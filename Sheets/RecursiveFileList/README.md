Prompts user for folder ID (or allows you to specify it in the code) and appends rows to the active sheet. This includes the following columns:
* File Name
* File Name (with html link)
* Revision Date
* File Type (currently commented out as it was causing issues)
* DocumentID
* Meta Data
* Folder Name / Path

Do keep in mind that for a large file list, you may reach the 6 minute script limit. This translated to approximately 3500-4000 rows for me but ymmv.
